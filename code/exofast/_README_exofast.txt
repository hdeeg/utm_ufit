This directory contains routines from EXOFAST by J. Eastman+ (2013) or or EXOFASTv2 (Eastman et al. 2019) which are required for UTM (for the analytical transit calculation) or for UFIT (for the MCMC). Hence, this directory needs to be in the IDL search path.

Routines whose name starts with UFIT* have been adapted to to UTM/UFIT; the others are unmodified ones.
