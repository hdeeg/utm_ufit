This directory contains examples for the use of UFIT with other modellers than UTM

ufit,'CMpolyfit2008.utm',1 
or
ufit,'CMsinfit2008.utm',1

will perform a combined fit (MCMC run) of a linear+sine function, or of a 2nd order polynome, on the data file that is included (OC9407_01clus.txt). This will reproduce reasonably well the coefficients in Table 2 of Deeg et al. 2008, A&A 480, 563. Note that that table was generated with a different fitting program.
