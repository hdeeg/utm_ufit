This directory contains examples to generate transits from objects with arbitrary shapes. At present (Dec. 2020) this is implemented in UTM on a prototype level, where the transiting objects are represented by 2D long-integer arrays of size  100x100 that describe the transparency, where 0 is transparent and 255 is totally opaque.   
Prior to running UTM, such a 2D arrays has to be generated by separate codelet, which saves them as 'transarr' into a .sav file

The examples below were prepared for a talk about Boyajian's star given at Univ. Graz on 2 Dec 2020. They show what forms might be needed to reproduce the shape of the first deep and smooth transit of that star, found in data from the Kepler mission. 

Example:\
utm,'rectsh.utm',3\
shows the transit of a rectangle-shaped transiter.

The files are:
- *.utm   example setup files
- *.sav   2D arrays for the corresponding setup files
- mk*.pro   IDL codes to generate the *.sav   2D arrays.
